this was a CAD assignment that was pretty difficult because not all of the demetions are listed and you need to find them out one at a time and sometime put in a number you know isnt correct.  
Here are some pictures of the project

this one was difficult because it was my first time i had done anything like this and so next time i will be better equiped to handle it. The most important thing is to plan ahead and put time into doing things right in the begging so you dont have problems later on.
